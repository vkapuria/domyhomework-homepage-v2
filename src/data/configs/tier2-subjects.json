We help you analyze historical documents, letters, speeches, government records, newspapers, photographs, artifacts, and other primary sources. Our analysis examines source context (who created it, when, why), evaluates source reliability and bias, interprets historical meaning, and connects sources to broader historical themes and questions. We teach you to think like historians."
